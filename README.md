# shellScripts
Various shell scripts I made or changed from sources found somewhere online

I wrote some of these a year ago and this is to reference my code for later when I do not have access to the files

# What's the point?
To act as a reference for myself or anyone else interested in reading or writing bash. System administrator, school, or just anyone wanting to learn, the files are free to copy and change and do what you will with!

Have fun!

# NOTE
please do not run stuff you find online, like these shell scripts, unless you know what it is doing, be sure the read the scripts yourself just incase someone's "autoconfig script" accidently breaks your system!
